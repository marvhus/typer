# Typer
A python script that takes a diff style file, and edits a text file using vim keybindings.  
The intended usecase for this is having it type out code for you, without you having to type it out in realtime.  
This could be used for example in video recording.

# Emacs Setup
install `evil` mode and set it up  
disable `electric-indent-mode` by pressing `M-x electric-indent-mode RET`
